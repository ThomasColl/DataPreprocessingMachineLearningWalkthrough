    "\n",
    "Data preprocessing is [defined](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/14650/data-preprocessing) as:\n",
    "\"Data preprocessing is a data mining technique that involves transforming raw data into an understandable format. Real-world data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and/or lacking in certain behaviors or trends, and is likely to contain many errors. Data preprocessing is a proven method of resolving such issues. Data preprocessing prepares raw data for further processing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In short it is taking raw data and making it useful. It is a very broad topic and features several substeps:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Cleaning: The process of removing bad data i.e. missing values, [noisy data](https://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/definition/noisy-data) or inconsistent data \n",
    "\n",
    "Data Intergration: Dealing with data with conflicts within the data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Transformation: The normalisation, aggregation and generalisation of data. This is to say making the data consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Reduction: Sorting data into simpler, more readable manner. e.g. the [Data Cube](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/28530/data-cube)\n",
